       "[\"I read all the ratings before I booked the Best Western Mission Bay. Couldn't believe it could be as good as I was reading for the price I was given. Well it is everything and more. It is a 3 floor hotel with elevator and easy to climb stairs. The room was just beautiful, as nice as a 5 star hotel I had previously stayed in. They offer a free breakfast with juic3, coffee, eggs, bacon, waffles, donuts, toast, danish and more. I couldn't believe how much when I walked in. The room was a bit small but people were nice with making room. This hotel is so close to Old Town and Sea World you never need to get back on the freeway unless you chooose to. I went up to Mission Bay and followed that into Old Town. Rooms are a great size also and lots of parking available. Its a fantastic hotel to choose and I will stay here on my next San Diego visit. The staff was the friendliest people I have ever met. The man who checked me in made sure I was happy and under stood everything. Pool has a code and he explainex that and it opened very easily. Nice pool abd nice spa. I liked that when I checked in the gentleman wrote the pool code and breakfast hours on the paper that held the room key. Very very professional and friendly. I didnt want to go home. Great Hotel. Thank You Best Western Mission Bay for making my two days the best ever.Good Afternoon,I am trilled to know you had a fantastic stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay and were happy with our staff, service and our Hot Continental Breakfast.

       " 'Booked for SDSU move in weekend. Two of our three nights were pricey considering this is a musty, ordinary, ugly hotel. Only one clerk at the front desk. He was very nice, but the lobby was worn and not too clean. The rooms appeared clean and pretty standard but the toilet was difficult to flush with the handle reversed. Second night the youth football team checked in contributing to noise and parking chaos. The free breakfast was not too great( I think the scrambled eggs were not real). Should have stayed anywhere else.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.',\n",

       " 'Nice safe newer Best Weatern. Excellent free breakfast lots of parking clean pool helpful front desk. Decent room appeared clean and feels good-- but somehow my bare feel got Filthy!! Get a room on an upper floor away from the stairs, because the parking lot sound funneled in all night and the staff chose to fill the Coke machine outside our room at 6:30 AM. Easy freeway access, but not really close to anything. Would feel safe taking children. Not terrible and good for the price.Thank you for your review. We will contact are vending company to not have them stock our machines that early in the morning. Also we will get the carpet cleaned',\n",
       " 'We arrived on an early flight and wanted to drop our bags at the hotel--they were able to check us in at 11:00am. That was a great start to our stay. The room and breakfast were standard Best Western fare. The location was perfect for our three days in San Diego. The hotel is just off I-5 and less than 20 minutes to Coronado, La Jolla, Old Town, etc. I have to mention Irma who ran the breakfast room. She was pleasant, kept things full, and checked in with every guest. Great service!',\n",
       " \"My family and I recently, December 2017, spent several days at this particular Best Western. We had three rooms with exterior access on the third floor. The second night there we realized why we were so warm was that our window was ajar by about 6 inches. So we closed and locked the window, and called the front office to inquire why it was opened. The front office said housekeeping must have opened it. I had my family close their windows also.Imagine our dismay the next day, when we stopped back to our rooms around 5pm, and all our windows were once again open. It would have been an easy matter for anyone to take a knife and slit the screen, slide the window fully open, and climb into our rooms. One of our rooms was occupied by a 23 yr old young woman. We once again relocked our windows. I can only guess that housekeeping was instructed to turn off the air conditioning, it was mid-70's, and open the window when they cleaned the rooms. I noticed other rooms on the 2nd floor were also left the same way.When I checked out I told Bill the manager that compromising the safety of guests was not acceptable. And, my guess is that housekeeping was told to open all the windows as part of the daily routine. I was not pleased he blamed housekeeping. I promised to inform Best Western at corporate headquarters and write a review, and I did both. Corporate was very supportive and shared my concern in regards to hotel safely. I have no doubt they took the appropriate action and future guests are now safe. But, check your windows when you return each night!Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are very sorry housekeeping kept your windows open during your stay. It's not a policy that we keep them closed but after mentioning it to the front desk staff.They should have been closed after they were done cleaning the rooms. Also they're are devices that keep our windows from opening more than 6 inches to prevent intruders from entering the room. We are very sorry you felt your safety was compromised but I assure you that never has there been any incidents were any of our rooms have been broken into.\",\n",
       " \"Room was very clean, beds comfortable. Breakfast typical for this type of hotel - 3 or 4 hot items (varied by day), cereal, fruit, yogurt, donuts, etc.. Pool area very small. Very convenient access to Mission Bay park (could actually walk there, but we drove to it), Sea World, easy drive to Old Town and Balboa Park, and airport. Not a bad drive to La Jolla, downtown and other attractions. Not a lot of restaurants nearby, but enough for a few days - a couple fast food, pizza, ribs. Grocery store nearby.

       " 'This hotel is in a great location especially if you are here with the family. It is across the freeway from mission bay park where there are places to play and relax. The hotel room was very clean but in serious need of an update. This is a reasonably priced hotel for the area. Parking is free and there is a great selection for the included breakfast. We have stayed at another resort hotel in San Diego and were charged for parking per day and resort fees per day and the resort room was not that much nicer so in comparison this place was a steal. My only complaints would be the noise. We were on the first floor and could hear everything going on in the parking lot. It was pretty quiet at night so getting a good night sleep wasnt an issue. I would stay here again, hopefully next time the rooms are updated. Thank you very much for the review. We do have a renovation that may start during the Fall.

       " 'We had sat down to plan a trip to San Diego... We had planned 5 days in San Diego.. We looked at hotels and motels by the beach. We quickly decided staying on the beach was super super pricey. This Best western worked out great. Although it is not on the beach, it is an easy 6 min drive from the beach. 6 min drive to old town San Diego as well. The breakfast had a great variety! I am gluten free and generally have limited options. This breakfast offered eggs, bacon, fruit and yogurt. They also offered a variety of other items as well waffles and breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. It can be a bit of a noisy place( to no fault to the hotel) Kids can be a bit rowdy lol The pool was so fantastic! We enjoyed it almost everyday. The room was clean and spacious as well. Parking was super convenient WE would definitely stay here again..Good Morning,Thank you so much for your compliments to our hotel. It is wonderful to know you were happy with your stay and location.

To keep them busy, I hooked up my media streamer to the LCD tv and away the kids went with their cartoons. The pool was a nice plus. While not too large, it was plenty for the people that partook. The kids made many friends while at the pool and we had several kids come to our room to invite my kids to come down to the pool. I can't say enough about the breakfast. The days we were at the hotel, the breakfast was amazing. Eggs, bacon, muffins, cereal, jucies, waffles, etc...just about everything that my kids love for breakfast.

       " \"In the past I have stayed in Hotel Circle which is difficult to navigate if you are not familiar with the area and the freeways. That area is also very, very busy with lots of traffic. The Best Western Mission Bay was literally right over the bridge from Mission Bay which made getting to the water very easy. However, I was disappointed that there are no ocean views from any of the rooms. Being this close to the water, I thought there would be.My room was comfortable, though there were some snags. First, the red light on my phone kept flashing the entire length of my stay, even though I told the front desk about it immediately upon my check in. It was a three week old message to someone who had stayed in that room previously.Also, the ice machine did not work on my floor, and I had to go to another floor every time I needed ice. Again, I informed the front desk about the non-functioning ice machine within an hour of my arrival and they just told me to use one on another floor. (I was on the top floor, and the elevator was s---l---o---w.) The ice machine still was not fixed by the end of my stay.The third annoyance was that there was no remote for the television when I checked in. However, they did send someone to my room with a remote within 20 minutes of my calling the front desk.On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff friendly. The best thing was the complimentary breakfast every morning. It had something for everyone and was very good. This really is a welcome amenity for me, since I don't like having to search out and drive to a restaurant first thing in the morning to have breakfast.The Best Western Mission Bay is a comfortable, no frills, convenient place to stay if you are just looking for a place to sleep and change clothes. Overall it seemed clean and safe. A few steps up from a Motel 6, but not a fancy resort either. A good compromise for the price.Good Afternoon,We would like to thank you for staying with us and posting a review for Tripadvisor.Thank you so much for your compliments to our property.

I suppose if you are staying and you have a car, it probably is a good location because it's really close to the highway- but we only stayed one night, so we didn't have a car, and the location was terrible. There was nothing to do near the hotel, I am not from the area, so it was hard for me to tell if this is a 'good area' or not, but I was not about to walk around alone. Our hotel room was clean and comfortable, but we only had one working outlet in the room. All of the other outlets were a major fire hazard as they only allowed the plugs to go in half-way. Breakfast was fine, but crowded and I couldn't get the wifi to work. As we were checking out, we watched a mouse swimming around in the pool.

       " 'Room needed some work, or a deep cleaning. It smelled like someone tried to cover a moldy smell with air freshener that smelled like cologne. Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dirty on one of the beds, as if someone had walked across it with shoes on. The room had a mini fridge but it was turned down to 1 so I had to turn it on to store my food items. I was given room 115, which unfortunately for me was right near the breakfast area so as soon as breakfast was available I was woken up by everyone walking by and holding loud conversations. Then at 7:45am, what I can only assume was a dance troop staying there, started practicing their routines in the middle of the parking lot while blasting their music and yelling. At 9am when I went to check out they were still going strong and oblivious to anyone trying to navigate the lot. When I was trying to back up, one of them walked up behind my vehicle and I had to ask them to move. Then after pulling out of my spot and attempting to leave, a few of them almost walked right in front of me because they were not paying attention. I find it extremely RUDE that they assumed everyone would be wide awake and want to listen to this. I also find it RUDE that the hotel manager did not go out there and ask them to stop because it may be disturbing other guests.

The main parking lot features a poor design, it is difficult to navigate when stuffed full of trucks, and other vehicles that should have been parked in the overflow lot provided to the side of the hotel. There were derelicts floating about the hotel and parking lot, which made me wonder whether my car and the contents would be there when I awoke in the morning, I was on a road trip back to Mexico with a full load and didn't really want to have to unpack an entire SUV late at night and have to try to piece it all back together in the morning. The room felt stale and just not clean, although I'm sure that it was, it just didn't feel clean, or look clean, the place is in need of an overhaul and I feel that I could have just crashed at a Motel 6 and left the next day feeling like I needed a shower just the same.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.I apologize you were unable to find a parking space by your room.

       " \"We called the hotel directly and were told we would have a walk-in shower, and that handicapped parking was directly outside of the handicapped rooms. We were given a non-handicapped room the first night, and parking was not close. They provided cones to block-off a space to allow for close parking and moved us to a handicapped room. The staff was very professional (other than one who swore in Spanish). We would probably stay again if they decide to create more accessible parking.Good Morning,I appreciate you taking time to review your stay with us here through TripAdvisor. I apologize the wrong information was given when you made your reservation. Our general manager is looking into converting two of our parking spaces into handicapped parking spaces because of comments like yours. Thank you.I'm very happy to know you were happy with the accommodations that were done to move you into a walk in shower room and reserved the parking in front of your room.

       " \"This is a very nice motel near the park at Mission Bay, and just up the street, there are restaurants and some shopping. It is not with a lot of other development, as far as shopping malls or tourist endeavors, but right near I-5 and easy access to points of interest from there. It is a clean, quiet motel with pretty much everything you need. It also has a nice breakfast. It doesn't look spectacular from outside (not bad, just not fab), but it is clean and more than adequate.Good Afternoon,Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel.

My family scheduled a trip to San Diego on Dec 2014 and we stayed there from Dec 9 to Dec 13 at room 231. During the time, we visited Sea world, Legoland, midway aircraft carrier museum, etc. Every night, we had a good sleep when we back exhausted from a whole day's trip.On the last day, In haste to catch our flight at LA, I left my wallet in room 231. The time I noticed it missing we were already back to my home in Canada. I called the hotel. The gentleman who pick up the phone was very kind and he asked me to leave my contact information. I am so happy the next day, because my wife told me that she got called from a Lady from your hotel that my wallet was found. And with your help mailing it to my home in Canada, I finally got all my card back (Driver license, debit cards, credit cards, insurance card, etc). I want to express my deep appreciation for all the services from BEST WESTERN Mission Bay, which leave us a very good memory for this family trip.

We weren't looking for a resort to hang out at all day, but rather a clean, comfortable place to come back to and sleep after seeing the surrounding area.

The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The continental breakfast was so-so. For the price, it fit my needs for one night.\",\n",
       " 'We wanted a place near Mission Bay and often go to Best Westerns. This was far more expensive than the price range indicated on Google Maps, but maybe we looked in the wrong place to get a good price. This is a basic motel with a NICE breakfast. I brought a tray back to our room with a nice variety of edibles, and two good coffees. Our room was clean and cool. The AC had a new setting for us: Dry. It kept the room nice and not humid, and it was quiet, too. We had a King bed with a mini-fridge and microwave. The Desk area had plenty of outlets for charging gadgets. The bed area could use more outlets for things like CPAP machines. (We went and bought an extension cord.) The sink area had a large counter surface, and the bath area was nice sized with a shower over the tub. Staff was courteous and efficient. The pool is small and was well used. There are several places to eat in the area. There were many families, and many foreign tourists here. Good clean basic hotel in a popular destination.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We hope you will come back and see us again soon.']"
